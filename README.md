### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Shohijahon Musinkulov. I am a front end developer and I have been working in this field for 3 years. My main working programming language is Javascript, and I work on the React.js JavaScript programming language library. 

In 2022, I studied programming at the "Najot ta'lim" educational center and improved my knowledge. Currently, I am mentoring in front programming in Samarkand, Republic of Uzbekistan.
